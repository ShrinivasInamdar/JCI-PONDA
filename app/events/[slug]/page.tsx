      <p>The JCI Ponda Community Clean-up Drive was a tremendous success, bringing together over 100 volunteers from all walks of life to clean up Ponda Beach and surrounding areas.</p>
      
      <p>The event began at 7:00 AM with a brief orientation session where volunteers were divided into teams and assigned specific areas. Each team was equipped with gloves, trash bags, and other necessary cleaning tools. The clean-up activity lasted for approximately 4 hours, during which the volunteers collected over 200 kg of waste, including plastic bottles, food wrappers, and other non-biodegradable items.</p>
      
      <p>Following the clean-up, an awareness session was conducted to educate participants and local residents about the importance of proper waste disposal and the harmful effects of pollution on marine life and the environment. The session also included practical tips on reducing plastic usage and adopting sustainable practices in daily life.</p>
      
      <p>The event concluded with a small ceremony to recognize the efforts of all volunteers and to thank the local authorities and sponsors for their support. Refreshments were provided to all participants.</p>
      
      <p>This initiative not only helped in cleaning up a significant portion of Ponda Beach but also raised awareness about environmental conservation among the local community. JCI Ponda plans to make this a regular event and expand it to other areas in the region.</p>
